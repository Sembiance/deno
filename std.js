// ALERT! MAKE SURE you are running the LATEST `deno` version BEFORE updating the 'std' versions below. This is important, been bitten by this first hand.
// Links to each of the modules below can be found here: https://jsr.io/@std
// Most of them can be found in the 'default' object which means not specifying the /subPath but that also pulls in more code then needed? So we target in most cases just what we care about
// For each one, open in a new tab, and update the version number below as needed
// Can see changelog here for 'all std modules' here: https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/releases
// Update denoLandX.js versions now too, before running any tests!
// Then go run the dtest in deno/xu to pull down the new std code, but also to test that nothing broke
