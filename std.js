// ALERT! MAKE SURE you are running the LATEST `deno` version BEFORE updating the 'std' versions below. This is important, been bitten by this first hand.
// Visit here to find latest version: https://deno.land/std
// Can see changelog here: https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/releases
// Sadly, because 'export' is a magic statement, I can't use a template string and have a single global "0.114.0" var
// So you need to search/replace to update version
// Update denoLandX.js versions now too, before running any tests!
// Then go run the dtest in deno/xu to pull down the new std code, but also to test that nothing broke
